    <p>Wait a minute! <i>How did we get here?,</i> you might be thinking, as you find yourself on a sudden new page. Huh! That's weird! (Okay, you are probably not thinking that, but let's pretend for a moment.)</p>
    <p>The link didn't take you to a new page: it took you to a new part of the page, previously hidden by some carefully designed &lt;div&gt;s.</p>
    <p>Now, you're on a new "page" of the CYOA narrative being written. (Well, it's not much of a narrative at this point, but you get the idea, I hope.)</p>
    <p><a href=#3>Go to page 3</a> for a better explanation, or <a href=#4>jump ahead to page 4</a> to skip to the code.</p>

  <h4>Credits Note</h4>
  <p>The general code concept of this system/stylesheet was inspired by the clever workarounds of <span title="It was a Hiveswap Friendsim fic featuring their MSPAReader and their OC, at least 5k, written as Interactive Fiction, I think for a fic exchange event?
