  <h3>Dump</h3>
  <p>Even when I thought to get a boyfriend, I couldn't muster up the courage to do anything. When I was in elementary school, I was bullied by many boys in school, and that trauma led me to avoid men. As a result, I don't even have any male friends at all now. The people around me have experienced love at least once, and compared to those around me, I feel more anxious every day...
The scratches are crawling. I'm shy and aimless, so what I really want is for the other person to come to me with as little effort as possible. I remember thinking to myself-  What should I do to get a boyfriend? After all, I did heard that having relationships is hard. </p>

  <h3>Mexican chocolate drink</h3>
  <p>Back in Mexico, there was a drink that was probably called ChocoLoco, I think. I think it had a Giraffe mascot on the box of chocolate milk, the colors were brown and yellow. The ChocoLoco also had a very small red-striped straw but the chocolate in it was sooo delicious. It was probably one of the best chocolate milks I ever tasted, but it was only in Mexico.

  <h3>Dump</h3>
  <p>Here are some stuff I think is lost media so I'll list them here.

If you seen the 1993 "Bonobono" Movie, there is a unreleased scene of Prairie Dog which I seen on Twitter. It was not a footage but only images of Bonobono, Chipmunk, and Prairie Dog together in the desert captured on screen. The scrapped footage was only on VHS but not on DVD.

I also found something that nobody really knows about but was from the same creator who made Bonobono. A white stoat that was called Guriri, and is the mascot of KHB broadcasting in Japan. I've seen videos and flash games about the white stoat and his forest friends which I think it's obscure. There was also a website about Guriri and it had short videos and a slideshow of picture drawings depicting Guriri and his friends. There were only two seasons of the slideshow, I've only saved a whole bunch of pictures in season 1 in Internet Archive but not season 2 yet...

About the videos, there was a movie called Jump Out Guriri! There were some available on Mercari which I wish I could get my hands on.
There was a trailer about it, which was on Niconico. There was also another dvd that was called Let's Play Guriri. It's not a movie but I think it's the one from the Oznoz website that was 20 minutes long. I never watched it on Oznoz but I would like to try and go watch.

There was one last video that it's probably lost by now and it used to be on Youtube but it is now unavailable, which showed a crossover with Guriri and his friends with Bonbono as well. I did not seen it before but I did seen a screenshot of Woo and Bonobono on a Bonobono blog which was Mikio's. I tried the Wayback Machine to see the video but an error occurred.

About the Guriri flash games, I did upload the flash games in Internet Archive but probably not all of them? There was one unplayable but it works at the start but it stays still at the loading screen. The game was about creating a forest together but unfortunately... you can't create and decorate a forest. It was not archived well.

I saved a unreleased footage of Bonobono 1997 which a user posted it on Youtube but it was now gone. It was their last message... I could not make out what were they were saying, and I don't really know Japanese. I do remember the description of the unreleased footage Bonobono Youtube video and it was interesting. I wish I saved that as well, I couldn't remember it well. But it explained well about the footage.

Recently, I discovered a game called Don't Starve and it is a survival game. The game used to be a web browser and was playable, and I think it used to be on Klei's website or Playstore I think? The game looked way different than nowadays and I never knew it could be on browser. It is not playable anymore and it is now lost in time.</p>

  <h3>Games I remember but couldn't find</h3>
  <p>Back in the day I discovered the Useless Web Website and I think I remember there was a 3d fish tank game that you can do anything with it.
I'm quite not sure how I found it but now it seems that I can't find it again. It must be still there really deep in the Useless Web or maybe the website game is gone forever.


There was a browser 2d multiplayer game that you can play as a little bird. I think I remember it was kind of like a warrior game or competing game?
Idk, but I really want to play that game again. I remember the stages there was green grass, hills houses, water, parkour.
I wonder if someone remembers that game. Therefore, I haven't seen any mentions of it online. I'm not quite sure if it's a birds' game or not but it's been a long time. There were players, but not a lot.

I can't remember if the birds held weapons. But it did seem similar to Angry Birds. But not really.</p>

  <h3>Dump</h3>
  <p>I remember that time, back when we went to vacation at Mexico. Everyone and my mom and I think my grandma was there, we're all in a car. I think I seen that we gave money to a man who looked like he was poor, and he only had a chair outside between the roads.

And at some time when we left I think, I think I seen that there was another man who took the money that was left laying on the chair. I didn't know what was going on in the first place. But I think that poor man who was with his chair left and walked somewhere. But I wonder why he didn't took the money with him?

And when we came back near it, he was back but it looks like he wanted to talk to us as he tries to get out of his chair. I looked at him and I was aware of that, I was gonna about to alert my mom about it but she was too busy talking to my grandma I think.

Then the poor man was going to knock on our window of our car but we suddenly drove away from him when the green lights went on.</p>

  <h3>Yep</h3>
  <p>I remember that time when I was young, I was in recess and I was just watching one of the kids playing on the hill. Probably rolling down the hill and the two girls got in a arguement and saying they are not gonna be friends anymore. This teacher, looked like she was being mad and strict. She was saying "This happens everytime, you girls be like: Be friends and not be friends again be friend and not be friends again be friends and be not friends again!" And so on, rapidly.
I wanted to laugh so hard at that so freaking bad! (I laughed inside) Those two girls looked dumb when she says those words. XD</p>

  <h3>(Rex the Raccoon?)</h3>
  <p>I remember reading a book about a raccoon that was lost in the woods and went to a house. And was adopted by the person that lived in the house.
There were a group of girls referred to as female cats that disliked the raccoon. The raccoon copied the girls even though they hated the raccoon.
I remember the cat was chased by a dog but then the raccoon saved the cat from the dog. Finally, the girls started to be friendly the raccoon because the raccoon saved the cat from the dog. 

When I was young, I actually have my page drawings of the book when I read it.
I still do have it... but I wish I could read that book again but I can't find it...</p>

  <h3>Tiny Thief Demo</h3>
  <p>Recently, I realized that the game has a early version! It looks so different... even the Jungle one though and it kinda doesn't look
like it's in high quality if you look closely <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTsgNj9Gu3E" target="_blank">Demo link</a></li>


The reason I'm curious about this is because it seems completely different from the original published game.
I wonder if that image I saw showing the treasure chest menu then it reads A cursed damn treasure instead of the cursed treasure was from the old version.
I would really like to play the old version! I think maybe the old version is on Steam, which I probably seen with the original game.

  <h3>Broken 3ds</h3>
  <p>It looks like the era of the nintendo 3ds is ending. I still have my little blue 3ds but it's broken. I've torment it with the 3ds when I was little not being careful about then the screen turned colors because it was probably my fault. 
Before my old 3ds was broken.
I remember watching Dinosaur Office and I remember that time that when you can watch Youtube on your 3ds as well and the I first time bought it recently I was confused how you use the 3ds because I was young so I accidentally resetted my old 3ds without knowing but what I do know there was a strange video playing when it was resetting.</p>
